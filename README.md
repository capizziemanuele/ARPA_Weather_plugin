# ARPA Meteorological Sensors Plugin

In order to use this plugin you need to install Sodapy and Dask libraries (Dask STILL NOTE USED - Working with API only for now).

Open the OSGeo4W Shell and type the following command.

You can use this plugin without API token (check whether it is necessary. Token allows access to all datasets on Open Data Lombardia on Socrata API without limits).

```
>> pip install sodapy
```

```
>> pip install dask
```
