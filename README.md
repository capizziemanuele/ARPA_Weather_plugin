# ARPA Weather Sensors QGIS Plugin

<img src="icon.png" width="100"> <br>
The ARPA Weather Sensors Plugin is a QGIS plugin designed to help users process time series data from weather sensors provided by the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection of Lombardy ([ARPA Lombardia](https://www.arpalombardia.it/Pages/Meteorologia/Osservazioni-e-Dati/Dati-in-tempo-reale.aspx)). With this plugin, you can easily import ARPA weather sensor data and process it using a variety of algorithms and methods available in QGIS.

## Installation
To use the ARPA Weather Sensors Plugin, you'll need to install a few libraries first. Specifically, you'll need to install [Sodapy](https://github.com/xmunoz/sodapy), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html), and [dask](https://www.dask.org/).

<b>Sodapy</b><br>
Sodapy is a Python library that provides a simple interface for accessing data from the Socrata Open Data API. In the context of the ARPA Weather Sensors Plugin, Sodapy is used to retrieve data from the ARPA Lombardia weather sensors.

<b>pandas</b><br>
pandas is a powerful data analysis library for Python. It provides data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets, as well as tools for working with missing data, time series data, and more. In the context of the ARPA Weather Sensors Plugin, pandas is used to process and analyze the weather sensor data.

<b>dask</b><br>
dask is a flexible parallel computing library for Python. It allows you to process large datasets in parallel, using a variety of distributed computing strategies. In the context of the ARPA Weather Sensors Plugin, dask is used to speed up the processing of large weather sensor CSV datasets.

### Windows
If you're using Windows, you can install these libraries using the `OSGeo4W Shell`. Here's how:

If you are using **QGIS 3.18 or lower**:
1. Open the `OSGeo4W Shell` as `Administrator`. If you already installed QGIS you can find `OSGeo4W Shell` in the Search bar. Type the following commands: 
2. Check the environment:
```
py3_env
```
3. Type the following command to upgrade pip (package installer):
```
>> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
4. Type the following command to install Sodapy:
```
>> python -m pip install sodapy
```
5. Type the following command to install pandas (raccomended **>=1.5.3** version):
```
>> python -m pip install pandas
``` 
6. Type the following command to install dask:
```
>> python -m pip install dask
```

If you are using **QGIS >= 3.20**:
1. Open the `OSGeo4W Shell` as `Administrator`. If you already installed QGIS you can find `OSGeo4W Shell` in the Search bar. Type the following commands: 
2. Type the following command to upgrade pip (package installer):
```
>> python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
3. Type the following command to install Sodapy:
```
>> python3 -m pip install sodapy -U --user
```
4. Type the following command to install pandas (raccomended **>=1.5.3** version):
```
>> python3 -m pip install pandas -U --user
``` 
5. Type the following command to install dask:
```
>> python3 -m pip install dask -U --user
```

### Linux
If you're using Linux, you can install these libraries using the QGIS Python Console. Here's how:
Install pip (if you don't already have it) using the Terminal:
```
>> apt-get install python3-pip
```
1. Open the `QGIS Python Console`.
2. Type the following command to import pip:
```
>> import pip 
```
3. Type the following command to install Sodapy:
```
>> pip install sodapy
```
4. Type the following command to install pandas:
```
>> pip install dask
```
5. Type the following command to install dask:
```
>> pip install pandas
```

---

Now you can pen QGIS and do the following step: 
Go to `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install plugins` -> `Settings` -> `Show also experimental plugins`

To use the ARPA Weather Sensors Plugin, you can install it as a ZIP file. Here's how:

1. Download the plugin ZIP file from the GitHub repository from the green box in the top right corner `Code` > `Download ZIP`
2. Open QGIS and go to `Plugins` > `Manage and Install Plugins`...
3. In the `Manage and Install Plugins` dialog box, click on the `Install from ZIP` tab
4. Click the `...` button to browse to the location where you saved the plugin ZIP file, then click `Install Plugin`
5. QGIS will install the plugin and ask if you want to enable it. Click `Yes` to enable the plugin

Once you've installed and enabled the plugin, you can use it to process ARPA Lombardia weather data.

## Usage
Once you have installed the ARPA Weather Sensors Plugin, you can use it to process ARPA Lombardia weather data. The plugin provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and processing weather sensor data.
Open QGIS and search for the plugin in the Plugins toolbar.

### Choosing the Data Source

ADD IMAGES AND DETAILS WHEN PLUGIN IS READY

With this plugin, you have the flexibility to choose whether to retrieve data from the Socrata Open Data API for the current month or from yearly CSV files for older data. You can easily select your preferred data source at the beginning of the process, and the plugin will automatically request data from the API or CSV files based on the selected date range.

It is important to note that using this plugin does not require an API token, but you may need one to access all datasets on Open Data Lombardia on Socrata API without any limitations (it has been left intentionally optional). Additionally, the CSV files are automatically downloaded by the plugin, and processed using the dask Python library.

There are a few important things to keep in mind when using CSV files with this plugin. Firstly, only dates within the same year can be processed, as the size of the CSV files is around 2GB. Furthermore, when QGIS is closed, all downloaded CSV files are deleted (to avoid to fill your PC memory). These files are stored in the tmp folder inside the plugin directory, and a link to the folder is provided by the plugin. Lastly, if the CSV file for the selected year is already available, the CSV folder won't be downloaded.

It is worth noting that sensor information is obtainable from the API. The data is available in two different ways: current month data is available from the Socrata API, while previous months/years data is available from CSV files that must be downloaded first.

### Selecting the Time Range and Sensor Type
Once you have selected the data source, you can choose the time range for which you want to retrieve data, and the type of weather sensor you are interested in. You can also select a province to filter the data by location.

### Removing Outliers
You can choose to remove outliers from the data using one of three functions: None (if you don't want to remove any data), Interquantile Range (IQR) or Z-Score. Selecting one of these functions will help you to remove anomalous data points that may be affecting your analysis.

### Exporting Layer Map and Summary Statistics
The plugin allows you to export a layer map of the selected weather sensor data, along with summary statistics calculated for the selected time range and sensor type.
When processing weather sensor data using this plugin, you can obtain a range of relevant statistics and multipoint layers for different sensors. These include:

- Mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, and count: for all variables, except for Wind Direction.
- Mode and count, for Wind Direction, which is expressed in Degree North.
  
These statistics are calculated based on the selected time range and sensor type.

<div align="center">
| Column Name | Information description |
| :---: | :---: |
| idsensore | ID of the sensor |
| media | average of the variable |
| max | max of the variable |
| min | min of the variable |
| std | standard deviation of the variable |
| conteggio | number of observations for statistics calculation |
| tipologia | Type of sensor (e.g. temperature) |
| unit_dimisura | Measure Unit (e.g. Â°C) |
| idstazione | Station ID (multiple sensors can be available at the same station) |
| nomestazione | Name of the Station |
| quota | Height of the station (m) |
| datastart | Start date of the time-series for that sensor |
| storico | Indicates whether the sensor is historical or still working (S=historical, N=not historical) |
| lng | Longitude |
| lat | Latitude |
</div>

List of exportable file:
- Map layer exportable in different formats: Geopackage (.gpkg), Shapefile ( .shp), CSV file (.csv);
- Time-series according to selected parameters;
- Sensors information for the selected provinces (sensors that are not functional anymore (Storico=S) are exported as well for completeness).

### Exporting Time Series Data and Sensor Information
You can export the time series data for the selected sensors in a CSV file, which can be used for further analysis or visualization in other tools. You can also export the selected sensors' information in a CSV file.
